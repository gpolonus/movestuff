<font class="speech">My website is so awesome that your computer may not like it. I (my name here) make an oath to you that there are absolutely NO viruses on my website(since i have no idea how to write any), or anything that was meant to harm your computer.
So to make sure my website functions properly you have to do the following:<br></font>
<font class="speech"><h1>1.)</h1>If when you go to my website you see this:<br>
<img src="badscreen.bmp"><br><h1>2.)</h1>it means you should right-click on the yellow bar as shown:<br>
<img src="badscreen2.bmp"><h1>3.)</h1>then this will pop up:<br><img src="badscrenn3.bmp">
<br>ITS OKAY!!! I assure you, NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPUTER!!! so click yes.<br>
Now that you've gone through the tutorial, click HOME at the top to continue on to the awesomeness!!!</font>
